###python code###
1. install chromeSetup64_84.exe // version 84 not 85
2. move 'chromdriver.exe' to the same directory of 'scrap.py'
3. move 'Out.xlsx'(must not rename this) to the same directory of 'scrap.py'
4. python version: 3.8.5
5. run 'py scrap.py'(but first of all it is need to install all package)

###scrap.exe###
if you run 'scrap.exe' then you can easily scrap without above course.
(but first of all move 'Out.xlsx' to the same directory of 'scrap.py')

note: when the code running in python or in exe, must not open the result.csv.
